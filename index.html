<p style="font-family:courier;">My name is Aarya Haque. I currently attend Thomas A. Edison CTE HS and am in the 10th grade. My shop class is web & design where we learn to make websites and webpages. I never would've pictured myself going in this field as I always labled myself a person not good with technology. However, even though it's just the beginning I'm very interested in this class and for my future. I am looking forward to see how I grow as a person and how I grow academically as I go through challenges to learn.</p>
